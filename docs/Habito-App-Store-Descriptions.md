### First Comment

```markdown
Hey everyone! 👋 I'm [Your Name], creator of Habito.

**Why we built this:**
I tried every habit tracker out there and they all felt the same—task lists
that made me feel guilty instead of motivated. I wanted something visual,
something that showed patterns, something that captured how I FELT about
my progress.

So I built Habito.

**What makes it special:**
• Monthly calendar view (not just endless lists)
• Daily self-rating on a 0-10 scale
• Beautiful progress visualizations
• Works 100% offline (your data = your business)

**Early access pricing:**
We're offering Product Hunt users [X% off] with code: PRODUCTHUNT

**Questions?** I'm here all day! Ask me anything about habits, productivity,
or why we chose purple gradients 😄

Let's build better days together! 💜
